## Add Search
Add a search input field under the Students Nav section. Should take text input and search all fields for students: name, statements, program, date, gallery, etc. 
Should retun list (in student section) with a header (see below) with the text input as the header.


## Add titles to groups within student list
Especilly for filters, so the user knows there's a filter on.
Group student thumbnails by program with a title above, even when looking at no filter / other filters. 
Break into new line for next program / header. See thumbnails_below design file in the reference folder.

## Add statement to student thumbnail on hover
Along with a lovely neon coral overlay.
