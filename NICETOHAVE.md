# Nice to have if there is time:

## Add titles to groups within student list
Especially for filters, so the user knows there's a filter on.
Group student thumbnails by program with a title above, even when looking at no filter / other filters. 
Break into new line for next program / header. See thumbnails_below design file in the reference folder.

## Add statement to student thumbnail on hover
Along with a lovely neon coral overlay.
